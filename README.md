# Implementation Plan for ML and MLOps Books (2024)

## Overview

In 2024, I plan to go through four kbooks on Machine Learning and MLOps. The goal is to cover one chapter within 3-5 days at maximum for each book. Here is the list of books:

1. **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** - by Greath James and Team
2. **Machine Learning with scikit-learn and PyTorch** - by Sebastian Raschka and Team (in-progress)
3. **Machine Learning Engineering with Python** - by Andrew P. MacMahon
4. **Practical Statistics for Data Scientists** - by Peter Bruce and Team

## Schedule

### Book 1: An Introduction to Statistical Learning
- **Chapter 1-3**: [Dates]
- **Chapter 4-6**: [Dates]
- **Chapter 7-9**: [Dates]
- **Chapter 10-12**: [Dates]

### Book 2: Machine Learning with scikit-learn and PyTorch

## Implementation Details

For each chapter, the plan is to read and understand the concepts, and then implement the learned knowledge into code. 

Feel free to check the progress regularly, and any suggestions or improvements are welcome!
